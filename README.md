    "Sales Invoice": {
        "validate": [
            "fbr_e_invoicing.api.fbr_validation.validate_fbr_fields",
            "your_app.custom_fbr_validation.validate_high_value_invoices"
        ]
    }
}
```

### Queue Priority Configuration

Customize priority based on business rules:

```python
def get_invoice_priority(doc):
    """Custom priority logic"""
    if doc.grand_total > 100000:
        return 1  # High priority
    elif doc.customer_group == "VIP":
        return 2  # Medium-high priority
    return 5  # Normal priority
```

### Scheduled Job Configuration

Modify processing frequency in `hooks.py`:

```python
scheduler_events = {
    "cron": {
        "*/10 * * * *": [  # Every 10 minutes
            "fbr_e_invoicing.api.fbr_queue.process_fbr_queue_scheduled"
        ],
        "0 */2 * * *": [  # Every 2 hours

        ]
    }
}
```

Error: Queue items stuck in Processing
```
**Solution**:
- Use reset stuck items function
- Check for crashed processes
- Review system resources
- Restart scheduled jobs if needed

#### 4. Missing HS Codes

### Debug Mode

Enable detailed logging:

```json
// site_config.json
{
    "developer_mode": 1,
    "log_level": "DEBUG",
    "fbr_debug_mode": 1
}
```

grep "FBR" sites/your-site/logs/worker.log
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Add indexes for better performance
CREATE INDEX idx_sales_invoice_fbr ON `tabSales Invoice` (custom_fbr_status, posting_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_fbr_queue_status ON `tabFBR Queue` (status, priority, created_at);
```

#### Queue Processing Optimization
```python
# Adjust batch size based on server capacity
def process_fbr_queue_optimized():
    system_load = get_system_load()
    batch_size = 20 if system_load < 50 else 10
    return process_queue(limit=batch_size)
```
